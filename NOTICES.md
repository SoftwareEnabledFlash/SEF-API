## License Acceptance

Per Community Specification License 1.0 Section 2.1.3.3, Licensees may indicate their acceptance of the Community Specification License by issuing a pull request to the Specification’s repository’s Notice.md file, including the Licensee’s name, authorized individuals' names, and repository system identifier (e.g. GitHub ID), and specification version.

A Licensee’s acceptance is conditioned on the Licensee’s agreement that Non-Volatile Memory Module technologies and any component(s) thereof are outside the scope of the Community Specification License (“License”), including any future versions, and accordingly, any patent claim covering Non-Volatile Memory Module technologies and any component(s) thereof shall not be deemed Necessary Claims, as that term is defined in the License, including any future versions.  

“Non-Volatile Memory Modules” means a memory subsystem consisting of a memory controller (e.g., a NAND memory controller), a non-volatile memory storage medium (e.g., NAND memory devices), an interface between the memory controller and memory storage medium, a microcontroller, and software/firmware running on the microcontroller or processor supporting the operation of the memory controller and/or of the storage medium.
To the extent that a conflict arises between the License, including any future versions, and these terms, these terms will control.

A Licensee may consent to accepting the current Community Specification License version or any future version of the Community Specification License by indicating "or later" after their specification version.
