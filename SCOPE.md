# Scope

This project is dedicated to the definition of the host API to be used for the Software-Enabled Flash Project SDK and native applications to communicate with Software-Enabled Flash compliant hardware.  Only the host API will be covered, with actual implementation in the hardware, firmware, and flash outside the scope of the project.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
