# Software-Enabled Flashâ„¢ Technology, a Linux Foundation Project

Software-Enabled Flash technology consists of purpose-built, media-centric Flash hardware focused on hyperscaler requirements, with an open source API and libraries to provide the functionality hyperscalers demand:
* Workload isolation in both hardware and software domains
* Latency outcome control via advanced, hardware-assisted queueing
* Complete host control of Flash management, garbage collection, and offload features
* Faster and easier Flash technology migration
* Creation of custom, application-centric and optimized Flash protocols and translation layers

Software-Enabled Flash maximizes Flash flexibility, performance, parallelism, and its value to applications.
